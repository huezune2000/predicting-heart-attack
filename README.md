# Healthcare: Predicting Heart Attack


# Description:
### Cardiovascular disease is one of the top contributors to mortality in the world. Millions of dollars were spent on medical treatment included medications, surgical intervention, and so forth. Instead of spending humongous amount of money in treatment, preventive measures can significantly impact population health in positive way. People can benefit from early diagnosis before heart attack and gives them the opportunity to take preventive actions.

# Project Objective:
### To predict the outcome, if there is a high or less chance of having heart attack. The target feature or y-variable is "output", where 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack. Dataset downloaded from Kaggle. 

# Process:
### This interesting project will start of with basic descriptive analysis, followed by data visualization along with exploratory data analysis, preparing the data, splitting train and test data, and fit into the model. Finally, the model's performance will be evaluated by classification report and confusion matrix.


# Potential Impact:
### Healthier population, less money spent on healthcare, reduce mortality rate due to cardiovascular disease.


# Dataset Description:
### Age : Age of the patient
### Sex : Sex of the patient
### exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
### ca: number of major vessels (0-3)
### cp : Chest Pain type chest pain type
*Value 1: typical angina
*Value 2: atypical angina
*Value 3: non-anginal pain
*Value 4: asymptomatic
### trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)
### chol : cholestoral in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor
### fbs : (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
### rest_ecg : resting electrocardiographic results
*Value 0: normal
*Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
*Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria thalach : maximum heart rate achieved
### target : 0= less chance of heart attack 1= more chance of heart attack
